"""
salesforce_mcp_server/server.py

Custom, self-hosted MCP server exposing exactly the two purpose-built
Salesforce tools this pipeline needs — see the plan doc ("Build a Custom
Salesforce MCP Server on GCP") for why this exists instead of using
Salesforce's own hosted MCP server (Identity Passthrough auth model
doesn't fit an unattended, org-wide backend service).

Deployed as its own Cloud Run service, separate from the main ADK
pipeline. Cloud Run IAM (--no-allow-unauthenticated) gates access — only
callable by authenticated GCP identities, not the public internet.
