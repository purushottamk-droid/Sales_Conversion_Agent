"""
salesforce_mcp_server/soql.py

SOQL query construction + response-record parsing for the two tools this
server exposes. FIELD_MAP is the single place mapping our clean field
names to real Salesforce API field names — verified against this org's
actual schema via verify_field_map.py. Four fields have no backing field
anywhere in this org (see the module-level note below FIELD_MAP) and two
have a second plausible candidate field — both flagged inline.

opportunity_id maps to the custom Opportunity_ID__c field, NOT the
Salesforce record Id — Gong's Gong_Calls_Data.OPPORTUNITY_ID joins on that
external-ID field instead, confirmed against real data.

All rep-scoped queries (opportunities, attainment) filter on
Sales_Rep_Name__c, not OwnerId — every Opportunity in this org shares one
OwnerId (a shared/integration user), so OwnerId can't identify an
individual rep. OwnerId is still kept in FIELD_MAP (as owner_id) purely so
callers can recover a real, valid Salesforce User Id for Task-assignment
purposes — Sales_Rep_Name__c has no corresponding Salesforce User record.

Relationship fields (e.g. "Account.Name") come back from Salesforce's
REST query API as NESTED objects, not flat dotted keys — parse_opportunity_record
below walks the dotted path to handle that.
